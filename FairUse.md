The material that is being defended for fair use of copyright is a song by artist Noah Gottaboa called Bak T00 skooL. He uses the sound file taken from the movie, Billy Madison, during the first 45 seconds of the rap song. The exact quote is found below:

> Oh back to school, back to school, to prove to my dad that I am not fool. I got my lunch packed up, my boots tied tight, I hope I don't get in a fight. Oh back to school, back to school, back to school. Well here goes nothing.

To determine how the piece of music is supported by the Fair Use, there are four factors that must be considered. [Under the US code 107 Limitations on exclusive rights](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107), the four factors are: 

1. The purpose and the character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non profit educational purposes
2. the nature of the copyrighted work
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

###Purpose

The purpose of the use is to demonstrate the vocal talents of a young Pittsburgh student trying to share his mixtape with a broader audience. He is using the sound file for a non-profit purpose to get recognized as a rapper with different types of lyrical volumes. This sound file sets up the entire song and allows the rapper to explain what happens throughout the rap. Noah sings about how he went through a tough school and how he could not afford mateirals such as books and notebooks. He does not mention the name Billy Madison or any other characters from the movie in his rap song. The song also does not revolve around the plot of *Billy Madison* and the purpose is not to take away views and money from the actors or the production company behind Billy Madison. 

###Nature
| Sources of Artists music   |    Type of source     |
|----------|:-------------:|
| YouTube |  Free video upload website that incorperates own copyright rules, conducts hearings at own copyright court and upholds copyright laws  |
| Soundcloud |  website that allows users to create any type of mixtape and post freely for users to download for free  |

The nature of the copyright work is in video form and mp3 sound files. The main source of his song is found on his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnQQM7nKh74). This is where he uses a stationary picture from the movie while the song is being played.The image for the YouTube video is not from the scene from which the audio is taken. He uses this photo to ensure that users will not know what the movie is about and not deter users from watching the youtube video instad of the 1995 movie. The mp3 sound file can be found on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/noah-gottaboa), which is a website that allows for free creation of music for users to download for free. In the song, Noah talks over the recording of *Billy Madison* and interacts with the sound file as if he is engaged in a conversation. He does leave the sound file playing alone and lowers the volumne of the file in order for the listen to hear him interact. 


###Amount
The amount of the material that is used is an important factor when discussing fair use. The material cannot contain too much of the orginal for the artist to use. As the [US code 107 Limitations on exclusive rights states](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107): "multiple copies of excerpts of works may be made, provided that the excerpts do not comprise a part of the whole which would constitute a performable unit such as a section, movement or aria, but in no case more than 10% of the whole work." The song follows these guidlines in such ways: 

* The sound file last 40 seconds out of the hour and 30 minute film, which is les than 10% of the whole work
* The sound file only exists in the beginning of the song and is not re used in its entirity in the song
* If a user decides to listen to the mp3, the user will not be able to know the entire movie premise and would not know where the audio is unless the user has seen the film

There is not enough of the copyrighted material for a user to know the plot of *Billy Madison*. The amount used is just to establish a nostalgia with the audience who have seen the movie and introduce a comedic effect into the song.

###Effect of Use

The effect of using the movie’s audio for a potential market does not affect the artist’s song. The movie has been avaliable for many years before this mixtape has come out and has become a classic movie to Adam Sandler fans. The creation of this song was created this year, which allows any user to watch the movie before listening to the song. The artist distributed this song on a CD free to any student at the University of Pittsburgh in the past month and has released his mixtape on the website Sound Cloud. If anything, the song will cause interest to the user to purchase/watch the movie and watch to further understand the use in the song. The song pays homage to *Billy Madison* and the artist does not have the intent of taking any money from the song.
