The material that is being defended for fair use of copyright is a song by artist Noah Gottaboa called Bak T00 skooL. He uses the sound file from the movie, Billy Madison, during the first 45 seconds of the rap song. The exact quote is found below:
> Oh back to school, back to school, to prove to my dad that I am not fool. I got my lunch packed up, my boots tied tight, I hope I don't get in a fight. Oh back to school, back to school, back to school. Well here goes nothing.

Under the US code 107 Limitations on exclusive rights, the four factors that judge the material for fair use are: 

1. The purpose and the character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for non profit educational purposes
2. the nature of the copyrighted work
3. the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole
4. the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work

The purpose of the use is to demonstrate the vocal talents of a young Pittsburgh student trying to share his mixtape with a broader audience. He is using the sound file for a non-profit purpose to get recognized as a rapper with different types of lyrical volumes. This sound file sets up the entire song and he references the beginning sound file throughout the rap. The purpose of the file is to help describe why he does not enjoy school and cannot afford the material. The purpose is not to take away views and money from the actors and the production company behind Billy Madison. 

The nature of the copyright work is in video form and mp3 sound files. The material that is under review of copy right is from the movie Billy Madison. The YouTube video only shows an image of the movie, not even from the scene where the audio is taken from. The YouTube video is not trying to deter users to watch the youtube video instead of the 1995 movie. He also does talks over the sound file and interacts as if he is engaged in a conversation. He does not have the sound file playing alone and in clear volume. The nature of the work is to establish a nostalgia with the audience and introduce a comedic effect into the song. 

The amount used from Billy Madison is very minimal and used to advance the song:

* The sound file last 40 seconds out of the hour and 30 minute film
* The sound file only exists in the beginning of the song and is used once
* If a user decides to listen to the mp3, the user will not be able to know the entire movie premise and would not know where the audio is unless the user has seen the film

The effect of using the movie’s audio for a potential market does not affect the artist’s song. The artist distributed this song on a CD free to any student at the university of Pittsburgh and has released his mixtape on the website Sound Cloud. Sound cloud is a free music site that allows artist to release songs on their own and allow users to download free of charge.
